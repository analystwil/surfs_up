# Surfs_Up Weather Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide W.Avy insight into the weather patterns in Oahu. He is interested in opening up a surf shop and wants to analyze the data to see if it would make sense opening up a shop in Oahu. 

## Results

June

Based off of the two tables above I was able to gather the key differences in which are below:
- The weather does not change much from June to December.
- The avg temparture in June is 75 and Dec 71 degrees. Which is only a 4 degrees difference. 
- The max temparture in June is 85 and Dec 83 degrees. I think the traffic would be the same due to the tempature. 
- The minimum temparture may be the deciding factor in which in June is 64 and Dec 56 degrees. Not sure how many people may visit the surf shop when its 56 degrees outside. 

## Summary

Looking at the completed analysis I think it would be a great idea to open up a surf shop in Oahu. Realizing the traffic may be a little lower in December due to the lower tempatures W.Avy may want to figure out a way to supplement income during that month.
